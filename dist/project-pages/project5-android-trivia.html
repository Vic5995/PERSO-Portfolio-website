    <p class="text1">
        I have done this project several times, this time I present it as a mobile application. The first implementation was done through a bootcamp on Udemy.
        <br>
        <br>
        When I took back the application, I removed the UI that I didn't like too much and for now, I stayed on the default UI.
        <br>
        <br>
        Once the UI was "restored", I wanted to explore the possibilities of the API I use to get the questions. Instead of having a default query, I created a form allowing the user to set up his game.
    </p>

    <p class="text2">
        When I made this change, I got a weird behavior from the application. While the game was running (the player had clicked on START), the application kept returning to the home screen.
        <br>
        <br>
        With the help of the debugger and StackOverflow (and the logs too), I found the cause of this behavior. For some requests, the API returns a different code if it doesn't have enough questions for the parameters that are passed to it.
        <br>
        <br>
        For the moment the solution is that when we receive this error code, we launch the default request and we inform the user with a snackbar that the parameters are the default ones.
    </p>

    <p class="text3">
        I've listed several things I'd like to implement on this application on GitHub.
        <br>
        <br>
        The next step will be to allow the user to answer multiple choice questions.
        I'm also thinking of saving the game data (with ROOM in particular) to allow the player his statistics.
