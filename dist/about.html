        <h3>Android Developer</h3>
        <p id="modal-ubi-desc">üèÅ First step in my career as a software engineer üèÅ
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            ü§ñ I worked in the Lille team as an <b>Android developer</b>.
            <br>
            <br>
            üê£ This professional experience marked my beginning in the digital world and this year has been a huge
            source of
            enrichment :
            <br>
            üì± I learned <b>mobile development</b> from scratch. Since UbiSolutions works with Android applications, I
            mobilized
            my knowledge in <b>Java</b> to gradually move towards <b>Kotlin</b>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Among the applications I worked on, I can mention:
            <br>
            <br>
            üëú A <b>bag tracking application</b>, with updates based on the scan location of the status of that bag
            (communication with a remote database)
            <br>
            üå° An <b>inventory application</b> using barcode and RFID chip scanning
            <br>
            üì¶ A pairing application (use to associate a RFID chip to a box and save this information in a remote
            database
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In parallel to these developments:
            <br>
            <br>
            üôãüèº I participated in <b>weekly check-ins with customers</b>
            <br>
            üìë I wrote <b>documentation</b> for my colleagues
            <br>
            üè° I had my first telecommuting experience (Covid-19) and learned how to best use all the communication
            tools
            available.</p>

        <h3>Software Engineer in training</h3>
        <p id="modal-dgfip-desc">üî• My current experience where I wear several hats as a web developer or data analyst
            üî•</p>
        <br>
        <p>

            1Ô∏è‚É£ During my 1st year, after understanding the digital environment in which I was going to evolve, I was
            able to acquire new skills:
            <br>
            <br>
            üñ• reinforcement of my basic skills in <b>web development HTML, CSS and JS</b>
            üõ† learning and using new frameworks such as <b>Bootstrap</b> and <b>Vue.JS</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>

            2Ô∏è‚É£ Currently in my 2nd year, my goal set with my tutor is to explore other technologies. I decided to
            choose a topic that was previously unknown to me: <b>data analysis</b>.
            <br>
            <br>
            üêç I learned the <b>Python</b> language and the libraries used for data processing like <b>Numpy</b> or
            <b>Pandas</b>. I also
            studied how to render this data with the proper visualization tools like <b>Matplotlib.plot</b> and
            <b>Seaborn</b>.
            <br>
            <br>
            üì± My next topic for this year is the use of a <b>cross-platform</b> framework (Flutter or ReactNative) to
                                                                            continue
            the development of an application used internally.</p>
