      This dashboard project was proposed to us in the first year of engineering school as part of the course on updating
      skills in development and design. The goal was to create a console application where teachers could consult the status
      of student attendance during COVID periods. It also needed a form part where students could fill in their change of
      status.
      <br>
      This project was to be done alone.
    </p>
    
    <div class="text1">
      <h4 class="text-secondary">Teacher side</h4>
      For the teacher part, the objective is to display the state of the attendance and absences of the students. When the
      teacher arrives at the main page, he/she can access different levels of precision on the students' sample. For example,
      at first all the students are displayed, then by class and then by year.
      Each time, we see the students who are sick (Covid or not), if they are on campus or not or if their absence is due to a
      professional reason.</div>

    <div class="text2">
      <h4 class="text-secondary">Student side</h4>
      When you are a student, you start with an authentication part (which is not completed on this project). Once connected,
      the student has several questions to update his status: is he/she sick or not? On campus or not? Is he/she absent for
      another reason? The possibility to leave a comment is also available. Once the form is validated, the results are stored
      in a persistent database.</div>
